Currently, the mainstream methods for measuring the concentration of alcohol solutions on the market are divided into contact measurement methods and non-contact measurement methods. Contact measurement methods include refractometry, densitometry, and electrochemical sensor methods. These methods are characterized by their ease of operation, portability, relatively low cost, and suitability for field testing. However, their accuracy is greatly affected by temperature and impurities, and some equipment sensors require regular calibration and replacement. They are mainly used in industries and scenarios where high precision is not critical, such as the food and beverage industry, on-site rapid testing, law enforcement and traffic safety, and educational and laboratory analysis. Non-contact measurement methods include spectroscopic analysis and near-infrared spectroscopy, which offer high accuracy and reliability but generally have high costs, complex operations, and high requirements for the operator's professional knowledge. These methods are primarily applied in laboratory research and industrial applications where quality control is crucial.

This study designed a non-contact alcohol solution concentration measurement system based on the absorption characteristics of alcohol in near-infrared light, combined with machine learning for comprehensive data processing from multiple perspectives. The aim is to integrate the advantages of both non-contact and contact measurement methods, reduce some of their disadvantages, and propose a system for measuring alcohol solution concentrations that is portable, highly resistant to interference, precise, relatively low in cost, easy to operate, and has low requirements for the operator.
